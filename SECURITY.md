# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The OpenStrata.MSBuild project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by email to: **security@openstrata.org**

Include the following information in your report:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** and severity assessment
- **Affected versions** of OpenStrata.MSBuild
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours of your report
- **Initial assessment** within 5 business days
- **Regular updates** on our progress
- **Credit** in security advisories (if desired)

### Security Response Process

1. **Triage** - We assess the severity and impact
2. **Investigation** - We investigate and develop a fix
3. **Disclosure** - We coordinate disclosure with you
4. **Release** - We release a security update
5. **Advisory** - We publish a security advisory

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using OpenStrata.MSBuild in your projects:

#### **Environment Variables**
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Never commit API keys or secrets to source control
- Use `NUGET_API_KEY` for NuGet publishing
- Use `OPENSTRATA_LOCAL_PACKAGE_FEED` for local package feeds

#### **Strong Name Keys**
- Generate strong name keys locally or in CI/CD
- Never commit `.snk` files to source control
- Use Azure Key Vault or similar for production keys
- See [SECURITY-STRONGNAME.md](SECURITY-STRONGNAME.md) for details

#### **Package Management**
- Verify package signatures before use
- Use trusted package sources only
- Keep packages updated to latest versions
- Monitor for security advisories

#### **Build Security**
- Use secure build environments
- Validate all inputs in custom MSBuild tasks
- Implement proper error handling
- Use least privilege principles

### For Contributors

When contributing to OpenStrata.MSBuild:

#### **Code Security**
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs and parameters
- Use parameterized queries for any database operations
- Implement proper exception handling
- Avoid hardcoded secrets or credentials

#### **Dependencies**
- Keep dependencies updated
- Review dependency security advisories
- Use minimal required permissions
- Validate third-party components

#### **MSBuild Security**
- Validate MSBuild task inputs
- Use secure file operations
- Implement proper path validation
- Avoid arbitrary code execution

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

- **Input Validation** - All MSBuild tasks validate inputs
- **Path Sanitization** - File paths are properly validated
- **Permission Checks** - Appropriate permission validation
- **Error Handling** - Secure error messages without information disclosure

### Security Hardening

- **Signed Assemblies** - All assemblies are strong-named signed
- **Dependency Validation** - Dependencies are verified
- **Secure Defaults** - Security-first default configurations
- **Minimal Permissions** - Principle of least privilege

## Common Security Considerations

### MSBuild Task Security

When creating custom MSBuild tasks:

```xml
<!-- ❌ Vulnerable - No input validation -->
<Exec Command="$(UserInput)" />

<!-- ✅ Secure - Validated input -->
<CustomTask Input="$(ValidatedInput)" />
```

### File Operations

```csharp
// ❌ Vulnerable - Path traversal risk
string path = Path.Combine(baseDir, userInput);

// ✅ Secure - Validated path
string path = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(baseDir, userInput));
if (!path.StartsWith(baseDir))
    throw new SecurityException("Invalid path");
```

### Configuration Management

```xml
<!-- ❌ Vulnerable - Hardcoded secrets -->
<NuGetApiKey>abc123...</NuGetApiKey>

<!-- ✅ Secure - Environment variable -->
<NuGetApiKey Condition="'$(NuGetApiKey)'==''">$(NUGET_API_KEY)</NuGetApiKey>
```

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning

We use various tools to ensure security:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL** - Static code analysis for security issues
- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency updates
- **Security Linting** - Custom security rules for MSBuild

### Manual Security Reviews

- All pull requests undergo security review
- Critical changes require additional security validation
- Regular security audits of core components
- Penetration testing of key functionality

## Incident Response

### In Case of Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Implement immediate containment measures
   - Notify affected users if necessary

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze the root cause
   - Document the incident
   - Develop remediation plan

3. **Remediation**
   - Deploy security fixes
   - Update documentation
   - Improve security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security procedures
   - Share lessons learned
